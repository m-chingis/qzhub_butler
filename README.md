Server \ cluster configuration script made for QZHub.com

## Disclaimer
This script is meant to be used by Power users. It's assumed that you know what are you messing with. All inputs and YAML config must be double checked for typos and mistakes. The script won't make the proofreading for you - it will just go on with what you've provided. Thus, there is a chance that your typos may cause a global disaster. 
Takiye dela ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

But apart from that, I hope you will enjoy using it to automate your DevOps routines :)
God bless your Linux!
